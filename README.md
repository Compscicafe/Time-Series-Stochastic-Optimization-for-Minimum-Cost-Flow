# Time-Series-Stochastic-Optimization-for-Minimum-Cost-Flow

This is a personal project of mine (under the GNU General Public License v3.0)

From the most rudimentary understanding of various Minimum-Cost-Maximum-Flow algorithms, this project aims to implement a rigorous, flexible and efficient statistical model (in Python and C++) for solving Network-Flow-based problems, esspecially those involving Min-Cost-Flow. 

Our primary targets are real life issues, stochastic-based situations, mostly depend on Time-Series progression. 

The methodology of our work will be thoroughly analyzed in the background files, which includes mathematical models, a variety of algorithms, different intuition on advanced applied maths and theoretical statistics, as well as some combinatorial optimization.
